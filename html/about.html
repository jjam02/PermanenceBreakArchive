      <p class="lead font-weight-normal">Permanence Break is a game made by a four person team for our UCSC CS:GD capstone project for the course CMPM171 Game Design Studio 1. At the beginning of the quarter our team was tasked with creating a vertical slice of our game by the end of winter quarter(a ten week period). The requirements for this project can be found below as well as how we fufilled them in the vertical slice of our game</p>

                  platform vendor if you continue to work on your game when the
                  course is over. For example, to get your game to rank well on
                  Steam or the Apple App Store, you might need to integrate with
                  vendor-specific APIs.)

            Vertical slices are not simply <em>small</em> games or
            <em>incomplete</em> games, but they are both small and incomplete in
            important ways.

            A vertical slices of a game is one that can be
            <em>scaled up to a full game</em> (at least ideally) using only a
            lot more authoring effort. That is, a production team should be able
            to fill out the rest of the content to build the full game using
            only digital content creation tools like image/sound editors, model
            editors, level editors, and scripting languages. Ideally, the team
            should not need to return to engine programming, file format design,
            asset loading and rendering pipelines, etc. Features that exist for
            the purposes of design polish (e.g. particle effects for feedback on
            player actions or fancy visual transitions between scenes)
            <em>should</em> be included in your vertical slice.

            Does your game have hand-painted text in images or baked into 3D
            geometry? You'll need to localize that text too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Does your game involve detailed spoken audio that would be
            impossible to translate while preserving the creative intent of the
            performance? That spoken content wasn't text, so it doesn't need to
            be localized. However, your subtitles will need to be localized.
          </p>
          <p>
            (For the accessibility requirement, your game needs to be
            completable without access to audio, so you might be adding
            subtitles to replace audio cues for that purpose. However, if you
            feel like audio access is not critical for gameplay, then you can
            skip subtitles and also skip the requirement to localize them.)

            ("solve for one, extend to many"), your games must be completable by
            players with limited abilities. What it means for a game to be
            <em>completable</em> or for someone to have a certain
            <em>ability</em> is largely subjective, so your team should use
            playtesting to get outside opinions on whether your game satisfies
            these requirements. For example, your game might be completable by
            your TA while they simulate the target set of abilities or you might
            be able to present evidence (e.g. a video recording) that most
            others are able to feel like they can complete the game under the
            ability restrictions even the your TA cannot do it themselves.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Limited Vision (Seeing)</strong></p>
          <p>
            Your game must be completable even when simulating vision
            limitations: contrast and color sensitivity.
          </p>
         
          <p><strong>Limited Dexterity (Touching)</strong></p>
          <p>
            Your game must be completable by a player using just one hand on the
            controls at a time. You may require multi-button mouse, multi-finger
            touchscreen gestures, or multi-key keyboard gestures, but you are
            encouraged to keep the core controls of your game very very simple.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Limited Audition (Hearing)</strong></p>
          <p>
            Your game must be completable by a player who cannot hear any sounds
            from the game (e.g. playing the game with system audio muted). Sonic
            art is an appreciated aspect of design polish (and it can help
            reinforce feedback provided by the game's graphics). However, for
            this inclusive design requirement, auditory feedback cannot required
            for the player to complete the game.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Limited Energy and Attention (Resting)</strong></p>
          <p>
            During a completion run of your game, gameplay should always reach a
            natural resting point within two minutes of active play without the
            player needing to take an extra action to pause the game. (The
            player may still face intense encounters, but they should somehow
            resolve or get to a situation where it is safe to let go of the
            controls quickly.)
