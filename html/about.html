            Vertical slices are not simply <em>small</em> games or
            <em>incomplete</em> games, but they are both small and incomplete in
            important ways.

          <p>
            A vertical slices of a game is one that can be
            <em>scaled up to a full game</em> (at least ideally) using only a
            lot more authoring effort. That is, a production team should be able
            to fill out the rest of the content to build the full game using
            only digital content creation tools like image/sound editors, model
            editors, level editors, and scripting languages. Ideally, the team
            should not need to return to engine programming, file format design,
            asset loading and rendering pipelines, etc. Features that exist for
            the purposes of design polish (e.g. particle effects for feedback on
            player actions or fancy visual transitions between scenes)
            <em>should</em> be included in your vertical slice.

            While many teams will decide to support English as one of their
            language, English is not required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, your team can avoid needing to translate text by removing all
            text from the game. Reducing the amount of on-screen text is often a
            good strategy generally. Using emoji or other icon-based
            communication schemes is a nice way to reach wider audiences with
            relatively little design effort.
          </p>
          <p>
            Does your game have hand-painted text in images or baked into 3D
            geometry? You'll need to localize that text too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Does your game involve detailed spoken audio that would be
            impossible to translate while preserving the creative intent of the
            performance? That spoken content wasn't text, so it doesn't need to
            be localized. However, your subtitles will need to be localized.
          </p>
          <p>
            (For the accessibility requirement, your game needs to be
            completable without access to audio, so you might be adding
            subtitles to replace audio cues for that purpose. However, if you
            feel like audio access is not critical for gameplay, then you can
            skip subtitles and also skip the requirement to localize them.)

            <strong>Note</strong>: About 50 of the of the 150 students in our
            CMPM 171 this quarter also took Adam's CMPM 121 (Game Development
            Patterns) last quarter. Every team in that class delivered a game
            available in 3+ languages (covering both logographic
            <em>and</em> right-to-left script). Localization was not a
            particularly difficult challenge for these teams. Many were able to
            use a tool like ChatGPT to translate all of the strings (and string
            templates) in their game in bulk, checking their work by having the
            system explain grammatical differences to them. Ask around on the
            CMPM 171 Discord if you need help with this.

            ("solve for one, extend to many"), your games must be completable by
            players with limited abilities. What it means for a game to be
            <em>completable</em> or for someone to have a certain
            <em>ability</em> is largely subjective, so your team should use
            playtesting to get outside opinions on whether your game satisfies
            these requirements. For example, your game might be completable by
            your TA while they simulate the target set of abilities or you might
            be able to present evidence (e.g. a video recording) that most
            others are able to feel like they can complete the game under the
            ability restrictions even the your TA cannot do it themselves.

            </li>
            <li>
              Use continuous motion (e.g. using tween-based repeating
              animations) to emphasize interactable elements from
              non-interactable elements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use animated transitions that reveal the most important visual
              elements of a scene first so that players can easily identify what
              needs their attention against a potentially cluttered background.

          <p><strong>Limited Energy and Attention (Resting)</strong></p>
          <p>
            During a completion run of your game, gameplay should always reach a
            natural resting point within two minutes of active play without the
            player needing to take an extra action to pause the game. (The
            player may still face intense encounters, but they should somehow
            resolve or get to a situation where it is safe to let go of the
            controls quickly.)
