      <p class="lead font-weight-normal">Permanence Break is a game made by a four person team for our UCSC CS:GD capstone project for the course CMPM171 Game Design Studio 1. At the beginning of the quarter our team was tasked with creating a vertical slice of our game by the end of winter quarter(a ten week period). The requirements for this project can be found below as well as how we fufilled them in the vertical slice of our game.</p>

                  We do not use any video files for cutscenes and wanted to

                </li>
                <li>
                  We also opted for the aesthetics of our game to use simple textures

                <li>
                  By optimizing our game around utilizing as few textures as possible, 
                  and having few levels, we avoided having to worry about size for the 
                  most part.

                desktop, mobile, console, browser, etc.). However, if Windows is
                supported macOS must also be supported (at least in principle).
                If iOS is supported, Android must be supported too (at least in

                  We made WebGL builds for playtesting purposes, enabling easier playtesting 
                  and more feedback for us to work off of. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  Our game is also easy to port onto other platforms and is nothing more than 
                  clicking a few buttons in Unity to build to macOS or Linux. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  Building to WebGL is slightly more complicated, but considering we've done 
                  it for playtesting purposes, shouldn't be too difficult or time consuming 
                  to make happen.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Narratives</strong>
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>The player - A thief who got a tip about a lab and becomes trapped within it,
                forced to solve puzzles to both escape and hopefully find what they came for
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Mechanics/Ideas</strong>
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A remote to control physics of cubes (can make a cube lose its momentum, or 
                alternatively, set a cubes velocity)
              </li>
              <li>
                A roguelike mode that allows the players to traverse throughout different lab
                rooms. This will have a day/night cycle where the player will have to reach a
                resting room by the time it becomes night.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Visual/Audio</strong>
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Dynamic audio (Ex. Audio changes depending on height a cube falls from)</li>
              <li>UI being a bit more stylzied (maybe animated)</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <h4>Scaling Localization/Accessibility</h4>
          <h5>How we plan to scale our current localization and accessibility options:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Localization</strong>
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We plan on keeping our language use at a minimum, making translation less of a
                headache. We also plan on allowing user-submitted languages by prompting
                them to fill out translations in-game.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Accessibility</strong>
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We plan to keep and maintain our current controls and accessibility settings. If
                we update our controls and add a button, we will also update our one-handed
                controls. As for other accessibility options, we won’t be changing our design
                principles for the game too much, so being able to play the game without audio
                and being able to take breaks will continue to be possible in future versions of our
                game.

            ("solve for one, extend to many"), your games must be completable by
            players with limited abilities. What it means for a game to be
            <em>completable</em> or for someone to have a certain
            <em>ability</em> is largely subjective, so your team should use
            playtesting to get outside opinions on whether your game satisfies
            these requirements. For example, your game might be completable by
            your TA while they simulate the target set of abilities or you might
            be able to present evidence (e.g. a video recording) that most
            others are able to feel like they can complete the game under the
            ability restrictions even the your TA cannot do it themselves.

              <strong>
                REQUIREMENT: Your game must be completable by a player using just one hand 
                on the controls at a time. You may require multi-button mouse, multi-finger
                touchscreen gestures, or multi-key keyboard gestures, but you are
                encouraged to keep the core controls of your game very very simple.

              <li>The game is completely playable with just a mouse.</li>
              <li>The game may prove difficult to play if playing on a trackpad.</li>

          <h4>Limited Audition (Hearing)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>
                REQUIREMENT: Your game must be completable by a player who cannot hear any 
                sounds from the game (e.g. playing the game with system audio muted). 
                Sonic art is an appreciated aspect of design polish (and it can help
                reinforce feedback provided by the game's graphics). However, for
                this inclusive design requirement, auditory feedback cannot required
                for the player to complete the game.

            <ul>
              <li>The game does not require any sounds to complete.</li>
              <li>
                Sounds might aid players in hearing when something is activated, but we have 
                ensured that players can visually see any changes they made with their environment.

            <li>
              <strong>
                REQUIREMENT: During a completion run of your game, gameplay should always 
                reach a natural resting point within two minutes of active play without 
                the player needing to take an extra action to pause the game. (The
                player may still face intense encounters, but they should somehow
                resolve or get to a situation where it is safe to let go of the
                controls quickly.)
              </strong>

            <ul>
              <li>
                The game does not have any time sensitive segments, meaning players can take 
                a break from their computer at any time.
              </li>
              <li>Progress is not lost upon players taking a break from the game without pausing.</li>
