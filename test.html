<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Offline Play Requirement</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>
      The game must be entirely completable while the player's device is
      disconnected from the internet.
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Games that support entirely offline play</strong> are much more
        likely to remain playable a few years into the future when you want to
        show your work off to others.
